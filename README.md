# Cryptography_biometrics
A webpage which demands biometric data in order to register or sign in 
There is a main page in which you have to choose between 1)register and 2)log in
If you choose register then you move to another webpage in which there is a form to be completed (Name, Surname, Username, email, Password and Biometric)
If you choose log in then you move to log in webpage which asks for a username a password and the biometric data.
Biomatric data is converted to hash before entering the database.
Those databases are linked with a specific database.
I used apache server and phpMyAdmin to control this database.
